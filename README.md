# pForce
A thin Web Framework for PHP (including site logins) for those who don't want to over-engineer (nor under-engineer) their web apps.  Used by BrainAnnex.org and others.

Use only what you need.  It doesn't twist your arm to program your web app in any particular way.

pForce: **May the *PHP* Force be with you!**


The pForce Framework was originally developed as part of the "Brain Annex" project, but is now independent of it.

This framework has been in active, continuous use on multiple web apps for years - some components for about a decade - and has been *released as Open Source* in Oct. 2019 as version 4.0
