# pForce
A thin Web Framework for PHP (including site logins) for those who don't want to over-engineer (nor under-engineer) their web apps.  Used by BrainAnnex.org

Use only what you need.  It doesn't twist your arm to program your web app in any particular way.

pForce: **May the *PHP* Force be with you!**
