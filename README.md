# pForce
A thin Web Framework for PHP (including site logins) for those who don't want to over-engineer (nor under-engineer) their web apps.  Used by BrainAnnex.org and others.

Use only what you need.  It doesn't twist your arm to program your web app in any particular way!

pForce: **May the *PHP* Force be with you!**


The pForce Framework was originally developed as part of the "Brain Annex" project, but is now independent of it.

This framework has been in active, continuous use on multiple web apps for years - some components for about a decade - and has been *released as Open Source* in Oct. 2019 as version 4.0

It is very modular, and it currently contains 10 components, with no external dependencies.

NOTE: the release of the pForce framework to Open Source is the first step towards the promised complete release to open source of the *Knowledge & Media Management* web app Brain Annex (https://brainannex.org)  As of version 4.0, pForce has an independent life from Brain Annex, but continues to be maintained and expanded by the Brain Annex project.
